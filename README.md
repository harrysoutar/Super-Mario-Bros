This repo contains all project work for "Super-Mario-Bros" a project in which a Super Mario Bros inspired game was programmed to be ran on the STM32 Nucleo board using an N5110 LCD screen and joysticks. This repo has been generated AFTER the project lifespan hence the closely aligned commit dates. There are multiple versions held in this repo but not ALL versions - the project logbook shows a breakdown of development.
